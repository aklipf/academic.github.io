# Research interests

My name is Astrid Klipfel and I really like using theoretical frameworks like group theory, graphs and circuits to solve real-world applications.

I did my PhD thesis entitled [**Equivariant Message-Passing Neural Networks and Probabilistic Diffusion Models for Materials Science**](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/en/phds/klipfel/) at the University of Artois from 2020 to 2023. My research was on graph neural network architectures and generative models for materials science. During this period, I proposed a method to build MPNN equivariant to both $$\text{E}(3)$$ and the repaving group $$\text{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$$ [**(E-MPNN)**](/publications/empnn-aaai23/), an efficient equivariant MPNN using vector fields [**(Vector fields MPNN)**](/publications/gemsnet-ijcai23/) and a diffusion model for periodic materials [**(Diffusion Model)**](/publications/diff-aaai24/).

Currently I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (CTU) in Prague and I'm very interested in Neuro-symbolic AI, first-order logic and probabilistic circuits.
